# Omakub!
## This is my personal configurations for most things, shared across most devices. The only real change made to the standard omakub setup is changing the alacritty.toml file located in ~/.local/share/omakub/defaults from starting runnig zellij to
## to starting with tmux so that I can bring over my tmux.conf
